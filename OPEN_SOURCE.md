## Why Open Source GAFF?

**My Vision:**

I believe AI agent orchestration should be:
- ‚úÖ **Accessible to everyone** - Not locked behind paywalls
- ‚úÖ **Community-driven** - Better together
- ‚úÖ **Transparent** - See how it works
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-ready** - Battle-tested and reliable
- ‚úÖ **Quality-first** - Built-in validation and safety
- ‚úÖ **Extensible** - Build on top of solid foundations

Open sourcing GAFF under MIT ensures it can be used by:
- üè¢ **Enterprises** - Like Marriott and Fortune 500 companies
- üöÄ **Startups** - Building the next big AI product
- üéì **Researchers** - Advancing AI agent capabilities
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Developers** - Learning and building cool things
- üè´ **Educators** - Teaching AI orchestration

**Thank you for using GAFF!** ‚ù§Ô∏è

Your acknowledgment helps others discover this project and contributes to the open source community.
